# Intro

In this series of tutorials we will build a dataset for HeLa cells segmentation from the [ISBI Cell Tracking Challenge](http://celltrackingchallenge.net).

The data can be dowloaded [here](http://data.celltrackingchallenge.net/training-datasets/DIC-C2DH-HeLa.zip).
Note that we don't claim any rights regarding the data, and use it solely for the purpose of these tutorials.
